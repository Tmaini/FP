# Overview/Objective of this Submission: The creation of a program that gathers information on the quantity 
# of new members that 15 trainers at Wally's Training Gym have joined is the aim of this submission. 
# The software then shows the number of trainers in each category and groups the trainers according to 
# how many new enrollees each one has.
# Variables Used: trainers (list): 
# A list of tuples where each tuple contains a trainer's last name (string) and the number of new enrollees (integer).
# category1 (int): Counter for trainers who enrolled 0-5 new members.
# category2 (int): Counter for trainers who enrolled 6-10 new members.
# category3 (int): Counter for trainers who enrolled 11-15 new members.
# num_trainers (int): Total number of trainers to be entered (15).
